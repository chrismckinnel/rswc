        <h2>Incident Response</h2>
        <p>
          At VCS we know things don’t run smoothly all the time.  Unexpected issues can occur on site, 
          causing compliance issues.  That’s why we offer our incident response service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us develop remedial and mitigation options that show local authorities you’re taking things 
          seriously.  We can also deal with local agencies on site for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          VCS has experience in managing large-scale incidents, reducing the likelihood of enforcement 
          action from the Council.  Let us minimise the risk of notices, fines, and prosecution action 
          that could seriously affect you and your company should the worst occur.  It’s just another 
          way we help to reduce the stress in an already stressful situation.

        <p>
          VCS has extensive experience in monitoring a large range of activities on the West Coast.  
          These include coal and gold mines, dairy farms, subdivisions, land development,  forestry and a lot more.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know the value of keeping local authorities on your side.  To help with this, we can 
          provide evidence that clearly demonstrates that you are complying with the environmental 
          standards you have been set.

        <p> 
          Do you find it difficult to deal with local and government agencies? Let us take the hassle 
          out of dealing with Compliance Officers and other governance agency officials.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can run the inspections for you,  providing a comprehensive pre-inspection report that enables 
          you to deal with issues before they become a problem.
