        <p>
          With many local and regional authorities tightening the rules around the disposal of dairy 
          effluent many farmers are having to look closely at their existing effluent management systems.
        </p>
        <p> 
          VCS has the necessary skills and experience to help farmers with this aspect of their business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effluent management is a high priority for many Councils and interest groups, VCS can design a
          system that meets Council requirements as well as future proofing your effluent system.
        </p>
        <p>
          VCS has existing relationships with other companies in the agricultural sector and can project 
          manage any system upgrade for you, from the initial on farm consultation to constructions and operation. 
          <a href="contact-vcs-environmental-management-services">Contact us</a> to set up an on farm consultation.

        <h1>Environmental Management</h1>
        <p>
          At VCS we recognise the importance of gaining a compliant rating from the Council – especially 
          with many dairy companies looking to impose penalties on non-compliant farms. This can be especially 
          difficult for absentee farm owners or investment syndicates. VCS can offer farm environmental management, 
          this includes regular visits to the farm, inspections that closely follow council checklists and 
          comprehensive post inspection reports that identify any issues that may be of concern to Council. 
          <a href="contact-vcs-environmental-management-services">Contact us</a> to discuss your specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          VCS can undertake the required water sampling, organise for the appropriate testing and forward 
          the results to Council for you – just another way we can free your time to allow you to concentrate 
          on maximising productivity on farm.
